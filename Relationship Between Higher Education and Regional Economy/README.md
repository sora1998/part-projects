### Introduction
This repository documents our research project, which aimed to investigate the relationship between a state's economy and its number of postsecondary schools (PSN). Our hypothesis was that there would be a positive correlation between these two variables. To test this hypothesis, we gathered and analyzed various economic indicators, postsecondary school location data, and population statistics from all 50 states and Washington D.C. in the United States spanning the years 2015 to 2020.

### Data Sources
Our research relied on the following primary sources of data:

#### 1. Economic Data: 
We collected a range of economic data, including Gross Domestic Product (GDP), income levels, employment rates, and other relevant metrics.
#### 2. Postsecondary School Data: 
We obtained information about the locations and numbers of postsecondary schools across different states.
#### 3. Population Data: 
Population data for each state and year was utilized as a confounding variable to control for its potential influence on the relationship between the economy and PSN.
### Methodology
Our research followed a structured methodology to analyze the relationship between state economies and the number of postsecondary schools. Key steps included:
#### 1. Data Collection: Gathering economic, postsecondary school, and population data for all relevant states and years.
#### 2. Data Preparation: Cleaning and formatting the data for analysis, including handling missing values and outliers.
#### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis: Conducting initial data exploration to identify trends and correlations.
#### 4. Linear Regression Analysis: Using linear regression models to statistically examine the relationship between state GDP and PSN while controlling for population.
#### 5. Results Interpretation: Drawing conclusions based on the regression analysis and providing insights into the nature of the relationship.
### Findings
Based on our analysis, we made the following key findings:
Through linear regression, we discovered a positive relationship between the number of postsecondary schools in a state and its Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
this positive correlation suggests that states with a higher number of postsecondary schools tend to have stronger economies, as indicated by GDP.
### Implications
Our research findings provide valuable insights into the relationship between education infrastructure (PSN) and a state's economic performance (GDP). These findings have implications for policymakers, educators, and economists, as they highlight the potential economic benefits of investing in postsecondary education. However, further research may be needed to explore additional factors influencing this relationship and to confirm causation.
