## Introduction
This report presents our evaluation of ChatGPT3.5 across a diverse set of tasks, including code comprehension, knowledge extraction, contest math questions, and broad knowledge-based multiple-choice questions. We explore the model's strengths and weaknesses and propose various prompting strategies to enhance its performance.

## Background
Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT3.5 have gained popularity for their adaptability in problem-solving. Understanding how to effectively formulate prompts for LLMs is crucial for achieving better results in various applications. LLMs are highly sensitive to prompts, and identifying patterns and preferences in prompt formulation can lead to improved performance and more accurate responses.

### Performance Evaluation
### Knowledge-Based and Code-Related Questions
Our evaluation reveals that ChatGPT3.5 excels in responding to knowledge-based and code-related questions. It demonstrates a baseline accuracy ranging from 60% to 70% in these domains.

### Challenges in Mathematical and Complex Reasoning Tasks
However, the model encounters difficulties when tackling tasks involving mathematics, complex reasoning, and arithmetic. In these areas, its baseline accuracy drops to a range of 20% to 30%.

## Prompting Strategies
### Modifying Prompts for Improvement
We propose various prompt modification approaches to enhance model performance without altering the original meaning of the prompts. These approaches include:

#### Integration of Relevant Information:
Incorporating relevant information into the original questions to improve overall performance by 3% to 15%.

#### Avoiding Irrelevant or Confusing Terms: 
Ensuring that prompts do not contain irrelevant or confusing terms, as they negatively impact accuracy.

### Enhancing Mathematical Problem-Solving
For mathematical queries, we identified three methods to enhance model performance:

#### Refining Problem Descriptions: 
Improving the clarity of problem descriptions.
Correcting Reasoning Steps: Ensuring that the model's reasoning steps are accurate.
#### Validating Calculation Steps: 
Verifying the correctness of calculation steps.
#### Implementation of these methods resulted in a significant increase in mathematical problem-solving accuracy by 20.56%.
## Chain-of-Thoughts Process Analysis
We manually inspected errors in the model's Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT) process and found that long or complex steps often led to a drop in accuracy. The model struggled to retain information from earlier steps, affecting its performance. Future work may involve the addition of a working memory system to the CoT prompting process to mitigate this issue.

## Conclusion
Our evaluation of ChatGPT3.5 across different tasks provides insights into its strengths and weaknesses. It excels in knowledge-based and code-related questions but faces challenges in mathematical and complex reasoning tasks. We've proposed various prompting strategies to enhance its performance, including prompt modifications and improvements to mathematical problem-solving.

Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how to effectively leverage ChatGPT3.5 and LLMs in general. Future work may focus on refining prompting strategies and addressing the limitations identified in the CoT process.
