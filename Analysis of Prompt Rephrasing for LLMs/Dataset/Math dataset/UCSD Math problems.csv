"Let $A$ be an $m \times n$ matrix. Show that if $x \in N\left(A^{\mathrm{T}} A\right)$, then $A x$ is in both $R(A)$ and $N\left(A^{\mathrm{T}}\right)$.","Solution: Let $x \in N\left(A^{\mathrm{T}} A\right)$, i.e. $A^{\mathrm{T}} A x=0$. Thus $A^{\mathrm{T}}(A x)=0$, so $A x \in N\left(A^{\mathrm{T}}\right)$. Clearly, $A x \in \operatorname{Range}(A)$.",Linear Algebra,Math 102,Proof
Let $A$ be an $m \times n$ matrix. Show that $N\left(A^{\mathrm{T}} A\right)=N(A)$.,"Solution: Let $x \in N(A)$, so $A x=0$. Clearly, $A^{\mathrm{T}} A x=0$ as well, so $x \in N\left(A^{\mathrm{T}} A\right)$. Thus $N(A) \subseteq N\left(A^{\mathrm{T}} A\right)$. Now, let $x \in N\left(A^{\mathrm{T}} A\right)$, so $A^{\mathrm{T}} A x=0$. Then $$ x^{\mathrm{T}} A^{\mathrm{T}} A x=\|A x\|^2=0 . $$ Thus $A x=0$, so $x \in N(A)$. Thus $N\left(A^{\mathrm{T}} A\right)=N(A)$.",Linear Algebra,Math 102,Proof
Let $A$ be an $m \times n$ matrix. Show that $A$ and $A^{\mathrm{T}} A$ have the same rank.,"Solution: Note that $\mathbb{R}^n=N(A) \bigoplus N(A)^{\perp}=N(A) \bigoplus R\left(A^{\mathrm{T}}\right)$. Thus, by dimension counting, $n=\operatorname{dim}(N(A))+\operatorname{dim}\left(R\left(A^{\mathrm{T}}\right)\right)=\operatorname{dim}(N(A))+\operatorname{Rank}\left(A^{\mathrm{T}}\right)$. Since the $\operatorname{Rank}\left(A^{\mathrm{T}}\right)=\operatorname{Rank}(A)$, we have $\operatorname{Rank}(A)=n-\operatorname{dim}(N(A))$. Similarly, $\mathbb{R}^n=N\left(A^{\mathrm{T}} A\right) \bigoplus N\left(A^{\mathrm{T}} A\right)^{\perp}=N\left(A^{\mathrm{T}} A\right) \bigoplus R\left(A^{\mathrm{T}} A\right)$. Thus $\operatorname{Rank}\left(A^{\mathrm{T}} A\right)=n-\operatorname{dim}\left(N\left(A^{\mathrm{T}} A\right)\right)$. But $N\left(A^{\mathrm{T}} A\right)=N(A)$, so the ranks are equal.",Linear Algebra,Math 102,Proof
"Let $A$ be an $m \times n$ matrix. Show that if $A$ has linearly independent columns, then $A^{\mathrm{T}} A$ is nonsingular.","Solution: If $A$ has linearly independent columns, then $\operatorname{Rank}(A)=n$. Thus $\operatorname{Rank}\left(A^{\mathrm{T}} A\right)=$ $n$. Thus $A^{\mathrm{T}} A$ is an $n \times n$ matrix with $n$ linearly independent rows, thus is nonsingular.",Linear Algebra,Math 102,Proof
Show that the diagonal entries of a Hermitian matrix must be real.,"Solution: Suppose $A$ is Hermitian, $A^H=A$, meaning $\overline{A_{i j}}=A_{j i}$ for all $i, j$. When $i=j, \overline{A_{i i}}=A_{i i}$, and hence $A_{i i} \in \mathbb{R}$ for all $i$. So all diagonal entries of $A$ are real.",Linear Algebra,Math 102,Proof
"Let $A$ be an $n \times n$ Hermitian matrix and let $\boldsymbol{x}$ be a vector in $\mathbb{C}^n$. Show that if $c=x^H A x$, then $c$ is real.",Solution: $$ \bar{c}=c^H=\left(x^H A x\right)^H=x^H A^H x=x^H A x=c . $$ So $c$ is real.,Linear Algebra,Math 102,Proof
"A fair coin is flipped three times. What is the probability that the second flip is tails, given that there is at most one tails among the three flips?","Solution: A = {second flip is tails} = {(H,T,H),(H,T,T),(T,T,H),(T,T,T)}, B = {at most one tails} = {(H, H, H),(H, H, T),(H,T,H),(T,H,H)}. Hence AB = {(H,T,H)}, P(A given B)=$\frac{1}{4}$",Probability,MATH 180A,reasoning
"We have two urns. The first urn contains two balls labeled 1 and 2. The second urn contains three balls labeled 3, 4 and 5. We choose one of the urns at random (with equal probability) and then sample one ball (uniformly at random) from the chosen urn. What is the probability that we picked the ball labeled 5?","Solution: Let $\mathrm{A}$ be the event that we picked the ball labeled 5 and $B$ the event that we picked the first urn. Then we have $P(B)=1 / 2$, $P\left(B^c\right)=P($ we picked the second urn $)=$ $1 / 2$. Moreover, from the setup if the problem $P(A \mid B)=P$ (we chose the number $5 \mid$ we chose from the first urn) $=0$, $P\left(A \mid B^c\right)=P$ (we chose the number $5 \mid$ we chose from the second urn) $=\frac{1}{3}$. We compute $P(A)$ by conditioning on $B$ and $B^c$ : $$\begin{aligned} & P(A)=P(A \mid B) P(B)+ \\ & P\left(A \mid B^c\right) P\left(B^c\right) \\ & =0 \cdot \frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{6} \end{aligned}$$",Probability,MATH 180A,reasoning
"I have a bag with 3 fair dice. One is 4-sided, one is 6-sided, and one is 12-sided. I reach into the bag, pick one at random and roll it. The outcome of the roll is 4. What is the probability that I pulled out the 6-sided die?",Solution: Define events: $A=\{$ outcome of the roll is 4$\}$ and $B_k=\{$ the k-sided die is picked\}. Then $$ P\left(B_6 \mid A\right)=\frac{P\left(A B_6\right)}{P(A)} \\ =\frac{\mathrm{P}\left(A \mid B_6\right) P\left(B_6\right)}{P\left(A \mid B_4\right) P\left(B_4\right)+P\left(A \mid B_6\right) P\left(B_6\right)+P\left(A \mid B_{12}\right) P\left(B_{12}\right)} \\ =\frac{\frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{12} \cdot \frac{1}{3}}=\frac{1}{3} $$,Probability,MATH 180A,reasoning
"Urn A contains 2 red and 4 white balls, and urn B contains 1 red and 1 white ball. A ball is randomly chosen from urn A and put into urn B, and a ball is then chosen from urn B. What is the conditional probability that the transferred ball was white given that a white ball is selected from urn B?",Solution: P (the event that the transferred ball was white | the event that a white ball was drawn from urn B) = 4/5,Probability,MATH 180A,reasoning
"We produce a random real number X through the following two-stage experiment. First roll a fair die to get an outcome Y in the set {1, 2, ... , 6}. Then, if Y = k, choose X uniformly in the interval (0, k]. Find the cumulative distribution function F(s) and the probability density function f(s) of X for 3 < s < 4.","Solution: We begin by deriving the probability $F(s)=$ $P(X \leq s)$ using the law of total probability. For $s \in(3,4)$, $$ F(s)=P(X \leq s) = \sum_{k=1}^6 P(X \leq s \mid Y=k) P(Y=k) =\sum_{k=1}^3 \frac{1}{6}+\sum_{k=4}^6 * \frac{1}{6}=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{37 s}{360} .$$ We can find the density function $f$ on the interval $(3,4)$ by differentiating this. Thus $$ f(s)=F^{\prime}(s)=\frac{37}{360} \text { for } s \in(3,4) $$",Probability,MATH 180A,calculation

"Consider a simplified scenario of the Monte-Carlo Tree Search w.r.t AlphaGo. Suppose you are at a certain state and you have 2 possible actions to take. You have explored the first action once but not the second one. You now choose among the same 2 actions for that same state using Q-value + Upper Confidence Bound. Assume that the Q-values are same for both the actions for that state. Which of the following are true?
(i) Your still choose the first action and explore the same path.
(ii) Since Q-values are the same, you toss a coin and randomly choose b/w the two actions.
(iii) You now choose the second action this time and explore that path
(iv) Since Q-values are the same, you don't explore any action further.",Solution: (iii),ML/DL,CSE251B midterm2,Multiple Choice

"In lecture, we saw that the Atari game Montezuma's Revenge was a difficult game for traditional reinforcement learning to solve. Why was this?
(i) It is a real-time action game with many creature races to choose from, each with different behaviors.
